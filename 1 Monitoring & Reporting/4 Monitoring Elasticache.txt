Monitoring ElasticCache:
=========================

* Cache most frequent database queriess
* ElasticCache consists of 2 engines

    * Memcached
    * Redis

* 4 different things to look at 

    - CPU Utilization
    - Swap Usage
    - Evictions
    - Concurrent connections


Memcached:
==========

* Handle loads upto 90%
* Multi-Threaded

Redis:
======

* Not Multi-Threaded
* No need to calculate the CPU Utilization of Redis



Swap Usage:
============

* Amount of the SWAP file that is used
* The Swap File is the amount of disk storage space reserved on disk if your comp runs out of RAM
* Size of swap file = size of RAM

    Memcached:
    ------------

    * 0 at most times, must not exceed 50Mb
    * If exceeds 50, increase the memcached_connections_overhead parameter
    * Amount of memory to be allocated for connection

    Redis:
    ------

    * no SwapUsage metric.
    * use reserved-memory usage 


Evictions:
==========

* Evicting a tenant from an aparament building

    Memcached:
    ----------

    * No recommended settings.
    * Either ScaleUp or ScaleOut

    Redis:
    ------

    * No recommended settings
    * Only Scale out


Concurrent connection:
------------------------

    * no recommended settings
    * Large and sustained spike in the number of concurrent connections, either mean a spike or your application not releasing connections as it should be.

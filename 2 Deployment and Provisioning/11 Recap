Recap of Deployment and Provisioning:
======================================

EC2 Launch issues:
==================

    InstanceLimitExceededError  - Exceeded the no of instaces in Region
    InsufficientInstanceCapacityError - no available On-Demand capacity to service your request


EBS volumes and IOPS:
=====================

    - performance benchmark for SSD volumes
    - increase the volume for more IOPS
    - gp2 - 16,000
    - io1 - 32,000

Bastion Host:
=============

    - host connected to the public subnet 
    - connect over the instances
    - securely connected to instances in private subnet
    - Allows you to securely administer instances without exposing them to internet
    - Incoming SSH/RDP only
    - Doesn't enable any outgoing requests

Load Balancers:
==============

    Application - Layer 7
    Network - Layer 4
    Classic - Legacy

    Pre-warming the load balancer for sudden spike in traffic
    Static IP addresses can be provided for Network Load Balancers, 1 per subnet
    Place ALB behind an NLB to get benefit of both


ELB Error Messages:
====================

    4xx - Client side errors
    5xx - Server side errors

ELB CloudWatch Metrics:
=======================

    Creat an Alarm to send your notification if a certain metric reaches a user-defined limit
    HealthyHostCount
    UnHealthyHostCount
    HTTPCode_Backend_2xx,3xx,4xx,5xx
    SurgeQueueLength - Classic
    SpillOverCount - Classic

Systems Manager:
================

    - visibility and control over your AWS infrastructrue
    - Integrates with CloudWatch, Trusted Advisor,config,CloudTrail
    - Organize inventory and logically group resources together
    - Run command -common ops tasks without logging into each one

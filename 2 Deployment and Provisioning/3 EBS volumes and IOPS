EBS Volumes and IOPS:
=====================

    - EBS - Virtual Disks attached to EC2 instance
    - can be used to create a File system
    - Focus on SSD backed storage - OS and DB's which are I/O intensive
 

EBS SSD IOPS:
=============

    
    
    gp2 - General Purpose -  boot Volumes
    io1 - Provisioned IOPS - I/O intensive


    gp2 - min 100 IOPS and max of 16,000 IOPS
    io1 - min 50 IOPS to a maximum of 64,000 IOPS


What happens when you hit the IOPS limit of your Volume?

    - I/o Requests queueing
    - App lagging


    gp2 - 5.2TB - 16,000 IOPS
    io1 - more than 16,000 IOPS


Exam Tips:
===========

    -  IOPS - benchmark performance for SSD Volumes
    -  IOPS is dependant on size of your Volume
    -  Increase the volume size if your IOPS max is hit

Elasticity and Scalability 101:  - Database Focussed
===============================

    - Think of a Rubber Band
    - Scalability - longer time frames


    EC2 : 
        
        Increase instance size as required - Scalability
        Increase the no of instances based on ASG - Elasticity

    DynamoDB:

        - Unlimited amount of storage (Scalability)
        - Increase additional IOPS for additional Spike (Elasticity)

    RDS:

        Increase instance size , eg from small to medium - Scalability
        not very elastic - Elasticity

    Aurora:

        Modify instance type - Scalability
        Aurora Serverless - Elasticity

    
    Exam Tips:
    ===========

        Elasticity - Scale with Demand
        Scalability - Scale out infrastructure

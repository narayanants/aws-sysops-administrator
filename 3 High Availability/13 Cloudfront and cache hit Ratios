Cloudfront and Cache hit ratios:
================================

- CDN is a distributed set of servers


Key Terminology:
=================

    - Edge Location - Location where content is cached
    - Origin - Files that CDN will distribute
    - Distribution - CDN which consists of a collection of Edge Locations


    More requests the Cloudfront is able to serve from edge location, the better it works


    How do you maximize cache hit ratio:
    ====================================

        - Specifying how long cloudfront caches your objects
        - Caching based on Query String Parameters
        - Caching based on Cookie values
        - Caching based on Request headers
        - Remove Accept-Encoding Header when Compression is not needed
        - Serving media content using HTTP

Share encrypted snapshots between accounts:
===========================================

    - You can share encrypted snapshots that are encrypted at rest using the AES-256 encryption algorithm

    - Create a custom KMS Encryption key
    - RDS snapshots with the KMS key
    - Share both to RDS of other accounts
    - You can't share the snapshot using the default KMS encryption key

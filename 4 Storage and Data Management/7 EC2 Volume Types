EBS vs Instance Store:
======================

    - Instance Store - Temporary/Ephermal Storage
    - EBS - Persistent


    Root Volumes
    Additional Volumes

    Root Volumes are terminated on EC2 Termination


    EBS backed Instance can be stopped
    Instance Storage volumes CANNOT be stopped


Exam Tips:
=========

    - Delete on Termination is default for all EBS Root Device Volumes
    - Set this to false however only at instance creation time
    - Additional Volumes will persist automatically
    - Delete these manually when you delete an instance.
    - Instance Store is know as ephermal Storage

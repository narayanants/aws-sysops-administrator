Upgrading EC2 Volume types:
===========================

Volumes and Snapshots:
=======================

    - Volumes exist on EBS
    - Snapshots exist on S3
    - Snapshots are point-in-time copies of Volumes
    - Snapshots are incremental
    - First Snapshot take some time


    Root Device Volumes:
    =====================

    - Create snap will instance is running
    - Create AMIs of both Snapshots and Volumes
    - Change EBS volumes on the fly
    - Volumes will be in the same AZ as EC2 instance
    

    Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted automatically
    Volumes restored from encrypted Snapshots are also encrypted automatically
    Share snaphots with other people, but only if they are unencrypted
    Snapshots can be shared with other AWS accounts

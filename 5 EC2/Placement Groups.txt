Placement Groups:
-----------------

EC2 Instance placement Strategy


     - Cluster - in Single AZ
     - Spread - in mutiple AZ
     - Partition - spread across of Partitions within a AZ



Cluster:
-------

     - Same Rack and same AZ
     - Great Network
     - If rack fails all EC2 are gone
     - Big data that needs to complete fast


Spread:
-------

    - Minimize failure risk
    - All the EC2 are located in different hardware
    - Reduced risk
    - Limited to 7 instance per AZ per placement Groups

Partition:
----------

    - instances spread across partitions across AZ
    - 7 Partition per AZ

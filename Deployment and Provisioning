Deployment and Provisioning:
============================

EC2 Launch Issues:
===================

    - InstanceLimitExceededError    - 20 instances per region
    - InsufficientInstanceCapacityError

EBS Volumes and IOPS:
=====================

    - EBS - Virtual Disks attached to EC2 instance
    - can be used to create a File system
    - Focus on SSD backed storage - OS and DB's which are I/O intensive
    - IOPS - benchmark performance for SSD Volumes

EBS SSD IOPS:
=============

    gp2 - General Purpose -  boot Volumes
    io1 - Provisioned IOPS - I/O intensive


    gp2 - min 100 IOPS and max of 16,000 IOPS
    io1 - min 50 IOPS to a maximum of 64,000 IOPS


What happens when you hit the IOPS limit of your Volume?

    - I/o Requests queueing
    - App lagging


    gp2 - 5.2TB - 16,000 IOPS
    io1 - more than 16,000 IOPS

Bastion Hosts:
==============

    - Bastion is a host that is connected to a Public Subnet
    - Connect over internet
    - Securely connect instances in a private Subnet
    - Allows you to safely administer your EC2 instances without exposing them to internet
    - Incoming SSH/RDP instances

ELB:
====

    - Application Load Balancer - Layer 7 - Application Layer
    - Network Load Balancer - Layer 4 - Transport Layer 
    - Classic Load Balancer

    - Pre-warming your Load Balancer for sudden and unexpected spike in Traffic
    - Static IP addresses can be provided by a Network Load Balancer. 1 per subnet

ELB Error Messages:
======================

    - 4XX errors - Client Side
    - 5xx errors - Server side errors
    - 200 - Success

Sample Error CodeS:
=================

     400 - Bad Request
     401 - unauthorized

ELB CloudWatch Metrics:
=======================

Metrics:
=========

     BackendConnectionErrors
     HealthyHostCount        - number of health instances
     UnHealthyHostCount     - number of health instances
     HTTPCode_Backend_2xx,3xx,4xx,5xx

Performance Metrics:
=====================

    - Latency   - no of seconds for registered instances to respond
    - RequestCount - no of requests completed in a specific intervals
    - SurgeQueueLength - no of pending requests, max queue size is 1024
    - SpillOverCount - no of requests rejected


Systems Manager:
================
Run Command:
    ===========

        - visibility and control over your AWS infra
        - Integrate with CloudWatch Dashboards
        - Organize inventory
        - Run command - common ops tasks like patching and updates, attac/Detach EBS Volumes


        - Run predefined commands on EC2 instances
        - Stop,start, re-size instance
        - Attach/Detach EBS Volumes
        - Run an Ansible playbook
        - Run a shell script
        - Apply patches and updates

Placement Groups:
=================

        Cluster - Same AZ
        Partition - Multi AZ
        Spread - instances are placed in distinct racks, with own network and power source
